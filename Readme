Case Study: Optimizing Mobile Fashion E-Commerce Redesigning the onboarding and checkout experience to boost conversion.

The Challenge: Mobile users often abandon carts due to complex navigation and lengthy sign-up processes. I analyzed industry giants (Myntra, H&M, Zara) to pinpoint exactly where friction occurs.

The Solution: Using Root Cause Analysis (RCA), I mapped the current user journeys and isolated bottlenecks. I then developed a high-fidelity Figma prototype featuring:

Simplified guest checkout options.

Progressive onboarding to reduce cognitive load.

Streamlined payment gateway integration.

The Result: A redesigned flow estimated to cut time-to-purchase by 20%, directly impacting Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO).


Toolkit:

Analysis: Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Funnel Analysis, Friction Point Identification

Design: Figma, User Journey Mapping
