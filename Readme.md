## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the **mobile onboarding and checkout funnels** for fashion e-commerce platforms. Through a competitive analysis of industry leaders (**Myntra, H&M, Zara**), I identified critical friction points causing user drop-off.

The result is a High-Fidelity Figma prototype designed to streamline the user journey and reduce **time-to-purchase by an estimated 20%**.

## The Challenge
Mobile cart abandonment rates in fashion e-commerce are often driven by:
1.  **Complex Onboarding:** Forced sign-ups before value realization.
2.  **Checkout Friction:** Excessive form fields and lack of guest checkout options.
3.  **Navigation Clutter:** Poor information architecture leading to decision paralysis.

## Methodology
I employed a data-driven design process to tackle these issues:

### 1. Competitive Analysis
* **Benchmarked Apps:** Myntra, H&M, Zara.
* **Focus:** Analyzed the "Guest-to-Customer" conversion path.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) & Funnel Analysis
* Mapped the current user flows to identify exactly *where* and *why* users were dropping off.
* Identified 3 major bottlenecks in the payment gateway integration and address input sections.

### 3. Solution Design (Figma)
* **Progressive Onboarding:** Deferred account creation until after purchase intent is established.
* **Smart Defaults:** Auto-fill capabilities and address detection.
* **Visual Streamlining:** Removed distraction elements during the checkout phase.
